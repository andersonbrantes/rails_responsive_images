# Rails responsive images

A Rails image_tag() extension to generate HTML5 <picture> tag markup from the W3C HTML Responsive Images Extension Proposal. Dont't care about image resizing, the gem will do the work for you - on the fly ;-) or just use the rake task "rake rails_responsive_images".

The following image_tag
```ruby
= image_tag 'awesome/picture.jpeg', alt: 'awesome', responsive: true
```
will generate this output:
```html
<picture>
  <source media="(max-width: 767px)" srcset="/assets/responsive_images_767/picture.jpg">
  <source media="(max-width: 991px)" srcset="/assets/responsive_images_991/picture.jpg">
  <source media="(max-width: 1999px)" srcset="/assets/responsive_images_1999/picture.jpg">
  <img width="2568" height="878" alt="awesome" src="/assets/picture.jpg">
</picture>
```

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rails_responsive_images'
